                                  Scanning Methodology -
check for live systems
check for open ports
san beyond ids
perform banner grabbing
scan for vulnerabilities
draw network diagrams
prepare proxies






Note : packet fragmentation can help against target  ------ to avoid ids use pkt. fragmentation








3way handshake -
syn100
syn200 + ack101
ack201



TCP header flags - 
syn
ack
rst   ----->> close communicaation in both direction
finish   --- fin  ---->> ordered close communication 
push   -- psh   --->>forces delivery of data without concern for any buffering
urgent -- urg  --->>> indiactes the data is being sent out of band





icmp msg type3 :
0  -- dest network unreachable
1  --- dest host unreach
6  -- n/w unknown
7  -- host unknown
9   --- n/w administratively prohibitted
10   --  host adm proh
13  --communication admin prohib






port scanninng -
tools -nmap
full open -->> aka tcp connect and full connect .it runs 3 way hanashake on all ports. Easy to detect. 
half open  (stealth or syn )  -->> no completion of thrree way handshake 
inverse tcp  -->.uses fin , psh, urg flags.No response means port is open
xmas  -->> 
ack    --->> ack packet sent and header is reviewed for rst packet to see if ttl is less than 64 that could us that port is open.
idle  -- spoofed ip addressss






banner grabbing - 
telnet -- runs on port 23 but run on http port i.e.80   -->  $ telnet ip_address 80



source routing






Enumeration -
discovery of hosts or devices







vulnerability tools- 
openvas
nessus
1) cvss
2) cve
3) vulnerability management life cycle
